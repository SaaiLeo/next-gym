# Description
In this project, we build a web application for gym management. In this application, we have three data models which are Member, Staff and Plan.

# Home Page
A manager can select the category which he want to manage. Example Staff page(Trainers), Member page (Customers) and Plan page (Subscription plan).

# Subscription Page
In our subscription page, all the subsription plan will be shown. Additionally, the manager can create new subscription plan. He can enter the plan name, how much it will cost and the duration of that plan in month. The manager can also edit and delete existing plan.

# Staff Page
In our staff page, all staff will be displayed. Just like subscription page, the manager can create new staff. He can set the staff name, phone number, monthly salary and working hours.
